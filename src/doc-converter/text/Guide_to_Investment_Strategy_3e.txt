Acknowledgements I owe a debt of gratitude to many individuals who helped me  with this book. First and foremost to my wife, Alex, for her continued  support and patience through this edition’s labour. Elroy Dimson  and Steve Satchell provided invaluable advice and suggestions  (as for the previous editions). Stephen Collins provided important  advice, suggestions and introductions. Colleagues at Delmore Asset  Management and the Financial Planning Corporation have been  particularly patient as I have been preoccupied with the book. Many  former colleagues have also been generous with their suggestions. I  also owe a substantial debt to the trustees and principals of the funds  that I have been privileged to work with over the years. I have been privileged to attend a number of seminars organised  by Norway’s Government Pension Fund (Global) in the past few  years. This book has benefited considerably from the insights gained  at these world-class meetings, which debate the interface between  academic research and practical investment issues. Generous and insightful contributions on particular issues or  chapters were provided by Victoria Barbary, Paul Barrett, Jörg Behrens,  Nick Bucknell, Jeff Bryan, Ewen Cameron-Watt, Forrest Capie, Norman  Deitrich, Robin Duthy, Hugh Ferry, Geoffrey Fiszel, Charlie Goldring,  Howard Goldring, Dietrich Hatlapa, Arzu Huseynov, Tim Lund, Yoram  Lustig, Cesar Murillo, Arlen Oransky, Steve Piercy, Mark Ralphs, John  Pullar-Strecker, Max Rayner, Christof Schmidhuber, Paul Stanyer and  James Wyatt. I am most grateful to each of them, but any mistakes  I am also indebted to those firms whose data I have used in the  numerous tables and charts. Without their support the book could not

My  thanks are also due to Penny Williams, who skilfully and patiently  edited the book. This book aims to help inform the process of seeking and giving  professional advice, but it cannot be a substitute for that advice. It  draws on and summarises research and investor perspectives on a  wide range of issues, but it is not punctuated with footnotes citing  sources for facts or opinions. Although important areas of debate are  flagged with references to leading researchers, in other areas ideas  which are more commonly expressed are presented but not attributed.  Sources which were particularly important for each chapter are listed  Please note that the views expressed in this book are my own and  may not coincide with the views of the investment funds on whose  boards or committees I am honoured to serve. In conclusion, let me say how privileged I am that Elroy Dimson,  Emeritus Professor of Finance at London Business School, has agreed  to write a foreword for this third edition of the book. Although my  appreciation of markets owes a great deal to the economics that I  learnt at Cambridge University, particularly from the late Michael  Posner and from Michael Kuczynski at Pembroke College, the London  Business School’s Investment Management Programme gave me an  invaluable bridge from economics to modern finance. 



Interest rates have collapsed. Savers who put aside money  now, to spend in the future, will earn little by way of interest. To  accumulate a target lump sum, they need to save more than they  once planned. Retirees, who wish to live on their savings, can now  expect to receive a smaller income from their investments. They must  adjust to having less to spend than they expected. Of course, low interest rates and low bond yields were for some  time clear for all to see. It was less obvious that low interest rates  imply low prospective returns on all assets, including equities.  Because investors require some compensation for the higher risk of  the stockmarket, equity returns must be equal to the interest rate plus  a “risk premium”. It follows that, other things being equal, a world  with low interest rates must also be a world in which stockmarket  investors receive lower returns. What are the implications of this dramatic change in the financial  environment? Peter Stanyer’s response is that every saver needs a  coherent investment strategy. Strategy must be underpinned by an  understanding of how markets move, how risk should be judged,  how markets reward investors and how investors behave. In this third  edition of his outstanding book, Peter Stanyer addresses these issues  and elegantly surveys the entire field of investment. He helps us to formulate an investment strategy that is realistic.  The projections made by many asset managers, retail financial product  providers, pension funds, endowments, regulators and governments  are optimistic. Overly optimistic estimates of future returns are  dangerous, not only because they mislead, but also because they can  mask the need for action. 

xxiv	Guide to investment strategy Investors vary in their need for liquidity, their tolerance for  risk, and their capacity to follow a disciplined investment strategy.  They therefore need to devise a strategy that reflects their salient  characteristics. The strategy should be founded on three pillars. The  first pillar is financial theory – how financial markets can be expected  to behave; the second is empirical evidence – how markets actually  do behave; and the third is the investment environment – the current  condition of financial markets. Peter Stanyer reviews the relevant aspects of financial theory in a  highly accessible way. He extends our knowledge without resorting to  complicated mathematics, explaining the central concepts of modern  finance in a clear exposition of the arguments for and against different  approaches. To better understand markets, he turns to the evidence of  financial history, often interrogating the long-term, global dataset that  my colleagues and I have compiled. He allows the record of securities  markets to enlighten us about events in the past and to underpin  informed judgments about the future. To interpret the current investment environment, Peter Stanyer  presents us with a wealth of data. Drawing together theory, evidence  and information on the financial environment, he does not flinch  from expressing a firm opinion. He presents valuable advice on how  to construct a fixed-income portfolio, how to think about liquidity,  what quantum of risk is acceptable for different investors, what  factors influence investment performance, whether investments of  passion are a store of value, and what behavioural biases investors  should guard against.  There is something for everyone in this book. It is comprehensive,  but never forbidding or opaque. The surveys of each of the main asset  classes – equities and risky debt, alternative assets like hedge funds  and private equity, and tangible assets like real estate and artworks  – are highly informative and the complexities of modern investing  are explained with great clarity. This book will help you meet the  challenge of investing for your future. 

Introduction: lessons from the  global financial crisis The years since the credit crisis of 2007–9 have seen a  number of refreshingly simple investment messages gain traction  that should enable investors to weather future storms in better  shape. These messages are as relevant to individuals managing their  own retirement savings as to the managers of the largest investment  One, emphasised by Antti Ilmanen, is that the timing of investment  volatility matters as much as its magnitude. Andrew Ang stresses this  by asserting that the two most important words in investing are “bad  times”. This is a theme running through this edition and it has several  aspects. One is that past performance patterns can easily give a falsely  reassuring impression of the likelihood of “bad times”. Another is  that investors should initiate discussions about how an investment  proposal might perform in bad times. If the investment will help  mitigate losses of income or capital and give flexibility in bad times, it  will be an attractive investment; if it might amplify them, and impose  inflexibility, investors will need to be rewarded amply for that and to  understand why the reward is expected to be sufficient, given their  circumstances. This applies with particular force to the costs imposed  by illiquid investments. Almost all investment products offer an alluring combination of  risk and return. When these offer a better prospect than normally  offered by the market, investors should always ask, how? Better  than market performance must reflect some combination of rare  skill; exploiting a market anomaly (but see Chapter 6); or a reward  for risk-taking (see Chapter 7). The victims of the Madoff fraud  suffered because they or their advisers accepted the description of  

xxvi	Guide to investment strategy past apparent good performance with low volatility of his fraudulent  funds as descriptions of how they did, and so would, perform. The  victims’ suffering was all the worse because their trust was betrayed  by Madoff (see Chapter 1). All investors need to ask for explanations of attractive performance.  Low volatility strategies in equities and credit are always popular,  and Chapters 7 and 8 encourage investors to suspect that obscure  risk-taking may be the explanation. If it is, investors are forewarned  that the attractive risk-return trade-off, which is a characteristic of  normal times, might provide little protection in “bad times”. This was  a message of John Campbell and Tuomo Vuolteenaho’s (2004) article  “Bad Beta, Good Beta” (see Chapter 7). It is also the message that hedge  funds and private equity are risk assets, and a usually reliable short  cut is to see them as types of equity investing. They will probably not  provide much help in “bad times”, but might nevertheless provide  interesting opportunities (Chapters 9 and 10). After 2008, some complained that the poor diversification offered  by strategies of risk assets could not reasonably have been anticipated.  These investors had often been encouraged by the prospect of  superior returns to abandon the safety of high-quality government  bonds. In the event they provided the security of income and, largely,  the diversification of capital values that would be expected of a safe  harbour in a time of crisis. As André Perold wrote in 2009: “Risk is a  choice rather than a fate.” Among those investors who emerged least scathed from the  financial crisis were many whose strategy comprised an allocation to  cash or government bonds (whose size was dictated by the investor’s  risk aversion), offset with an allocation to diversified equities. This  approach echoes the portfolio separation theorem of the late James  Tobin (see Chapter 5), and many financial advisers (and some  institutional investors) served their clients well by adhering to this  simple approach. However, the era of ultra-low interest rates in the  years after 2008, and the purchase of one-third of the US national debt  (and also large quantities of high-quality mortgages) by the Federal  Reserve and of one-quarter of the UK’s national debt by the Bank of  England, forced cautious investors to take more risk and to scale back  holdings of increasingly expensive government bonds. The dilemma  

Introduction: lessons from the global financial crisisxxvii of choosing between credit risk and interest-rate risk has hung over  income-seeking investors of all types in the years since 2009. This  dilemma underlies the debates about whether investors can hope  to “time” markets and the role of fixed asset allocation models in  Chapters 4 and 5. Negligible interest rates have had an all-pervading impact. In  Chapter 4, survey evidence is reported of substantial holdings of  liquidity by high net worth individuals across different wealth bands.  The loss of interest income by these wealthy families will have  significantly lowered the opportunity cost of indulging in investments  of passion. This almost certainly helps to explain the buoyancy of  markets ranging from classic cars, stamps and vintage wine to fine  art (see Chapter 12). The far-reaching influence on these markets  of the Federal Reserve’s response to the global financial crisis was  reflected in an article in the New York Times in early 2013: “Whether  he intended it or not, or even realises it, Ben S. Bernanke has become  a patron of the arts.” I would welcome any feedback and can be contacted at the  following email address: peter@peterstanyer.com. 



The big picture 



1 	 Setting the scene Think about risk before it hits you Risk is about bad outcomes, and a bad outcome that is expected to  arrive at a bad time is especially damaging and requires particularly  attractive rewards. Investors and their advisers have typically judged  the riskiness of an investment by its volatility, but in the words of  Antti Ilmanen, author of Expected Returns: An Investor’s Guide to  Harvesting Market Rewards, not all volatilities are equal, and the  timing of bad outcomes matters for risk as much as the scale of  those bad outcomes. A theme throughout this book is that investors  should think about how investments might perform in bad times as  the key to understanding how much risk they are taking. There is  little discussion of what constitutes a bad time, which will vary from  investor to investor, but it is best captured by Ilmanen, who defines  it as a time when an extra dollar of ready cash feels especially  What constitutes a bad outcome is far from simple. It is determined  by each investor (and not by the textbooks). It varies from one  investor to another and from investment to investment. If an investor  is saving for a pension, or to pay off a mortgage, or to fund a child’s  education, the bad outcome that matters is the risk of a shortfall from  the investment objective. This is different from the risk of a negative  return. In Chapter 5, the distinction is drawn between threats to future  income (which is of concern to a pensioner) and threats to the value  of investments (which matter to a cautious short-term investor). This  shows that the short-term risk of losing money is inadequate as a  general measure of risk. 

Guide to investment strategy Risk is about failing to meet particular objectives. But it is  also about the chance of anything happening before then which  undermines an investor’s confidence in that future objective being  met. Since those working in the investment business are uncertain  about market relationships, it is reasonable for investors to be at  least as uncertain. It is also reasonable for their confidence to be  shaken by disappointing developments along the way, even if those  developments are not surprising to a quantitative analyst. Investors’  expectations are naturally updated as time evolves and as their  own experience (and everyone else’s) grows. So far as the investor  is concerned, the perceived risk of a bad outcome will be increased  by disappointments before the target date is reached, undermining  confidence in the investment strategy. The pattern of investment returns along the way matters to  investors, not just the final return at some target date in the future. This  focus on the risk of suffering unacceptable losses at any stage before  an investor’s target date has highlighted the dangers of mismeasuring  risk. An investor might accept some low probability of a particular  bad outcome occurring after, say, three years. However, the likelihood  of that poor threshold being breached at some stage before the end of  the three years will be much higher than the investor might expect.  The danger is that the investor’s attention and judgment are initially  drawn only to the complete three-year period. As the period is  extended, the risk of experiencing particularly poor interim results, at  some time, can increase dramatically. The insights from behavioural finance (see Chapter 2) on  investor loss aversion are particularly important here. Disappointing  performance disproportionately undermines investor confidence.  The risk of this, and its repercussions for the likelihood of achieving  longer-term objectives, represents issues that investors need to discuss  regularly with their advisers, especially when they are considering  moving to a higher-risk strategy. Research findings from behavioural finance emphasise that  investors often attach different importance to achieving different  goals. The risk of bad outcomes should be reduced, as far as possible,  for objectives that the investor regards as most critical to achieve, and,  ideally, any high risk of missing objectives should be focused on the  

Setting the scene nice-to-have but dispensable targets. Investors may then be less likely  to react adversely to the disappointments that inevitably accompany  risk-based strategies. They will know that such targets are less critical  Risk is about the chance of disappointing outcomes. Risk can  be managed but disappointing outcomes cannot, and surprising  things sometimes happen. However, measuring the volatility of  performance, as a check on what the statistical models say is likely,  can be helpful in coming to an independent assessment of risk. But it  will always be based on a small sample of data. Thus we can attempt  to measure risks we perceive. Risks that exist but that we do not  have the imagination or the data to measure will always escape our  metrics. There is no solution to this problem of measuring risk, which  led Glynn Holton to write in Financial Analysts Journal in 2004: “It  is meaningless to ask if a risk metric captures risk. Instead, ask if it is  More often than not, the real problem is that unusual risk-taking is  rewarded rather than penalised. We need to avoid drawing the wrong  conclusions about the good times as well as the bad times. This theme  is captured by a photograph at the front of Frank Sortino and Stephen  Satchell’s book Managing Downside Risk in Financial Markets. It shows  Karen Sortino on safari in Africa, petting an intimidating rhino. The  caption underneath reads: “Just because you got away with it, doesn’t  mean you didn’t take any risk.” The Madoff fraud If risk is about bad outcomes, to be a victim of fraud is a particularly bad  outcome. But when we look after our own savings and investments  we are often our own worst enemies. Many people expect savings  and investments, in which they have no particular fascination, to  be a difficult subject that they do not expect to understand. Any  opportunity that presents itself to take a short cut and, in the words  of Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics and Eugene  Higgins emeritus professor of psychology at Princeton University,  to “think fast”, which easily leads to avoidable mistakes, rather than  “thinking slow”, which requires some concentration and effort, will  

Guide to investment strategy be tempting. Our lazy inclination to “think fast” (see Chapter 2) is  readily exploited by fraudsters who are attracted to our money and  our behavioural weaknesses like bees to a honey pot. The enormous  Madoff fraud that unravelled in December 2008 provides salutary  lessons for us all. At the end of November 2008, the accounts of the clients of  Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, an investment adviser  registered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),  had a supposed aggregate value of $64.8 billion invested in the  supposedly sophisticated investment strategy run by Bernie Madoff.  His firm had been in operation since the 1960s and it is thought that  his fraud started sometime in the 1970s. It lasted until 11th December  2008 when he was arrested and his business was exposed as a  huge scam, probably the largest securities fraud the world has ever  The amounts that Madoff’s investors thought they owned had  been inflated by fictitious investment performance ever since they  had first invested, and the amount that Madoff actually controlled  was further reduced because early investors, who then withdrew  money, were paid their inflated investment values with billions of  dollars provided by later investors. The court-appointed liquidator  has estimated the actual losses to investors of money they originally  invested to be around $17.5 billion. Nevertheless, at one stage investors  believed that they had assets – which, unknown to them, were mostly  fictitious – worth $65 billion invested with Madoff. By September  2013, the liquidators had recovered or entered into agreements to  recover, often from early beneficiaries of the fraud, $9.5 billion or 54%  of the estimated losses of amounts invested with the firm, and actual  distributions to investors totalled $5.6 billion. It is likely that the trustee  for the liquidation, Irving S. Picard, will succeed in recovering much  more than was initially feared of the amounts originally invested.  Nevertheless, investors have been left nursing huge losses from what  they believed was their wealth. Unless they remain alert, others are  in danger of repeating the mistakes that led so many to lose so much.  So how can investors protect themselves? Madoff’s investment strategy seemingly offered the attractive  combination of a long-run performance comparable to the  

Setting the scene stockmarket but, supposedly thanks to clever use of derivatives, with  little volatility. Marketing material from fund distributors presented the track  record of Madoff’s fraud in the way shown in Figure 1.1 for Fairfield  Sentry, a so-called feeder fund which was entirely invested in Madoff’s  scam. It showed the seductive combination of apparently low risk  and high, but perhaps not outrageous, returns. But an experienced  adviser or investor should immediately recognise that the track record  shown for Fairfield Sentry looks odd. It is always safe to assume that  no investment strategy can deliver such smooth returns well in excess  of the guaranteed rate on Treasury bills and that there are no low-risk  routes to returns well above the return on cash. Madoff’s strategy was a simple Ponzi scheme, whereby a  fraudulent rate of return is promised, seemingly verified in this case  by the experience of those early investors who had been able to  withdraw inflated amounts. So long as only a few investors demand  their money back, they can be paid what they have been told their  FIG 1.1  If it looks too good to be true, it probably is  Madoﬀ’s ﬁctitious cumulative performance compared with market indices,  Dec 1990–Nov 2007, Dec 1990=100 Sources: Barclays, Fairﬁeld Sentry client reports; MSCI Fairﬁeld Sentry MSCI USA equity  index gross return Barclays US Aggregate bond  index total return Barclays US Treasury bill  

Guide to investment strategy investment is now worth. But what they had been told was a lie, and  the inflated returns were delivered to a few by redirecting cash from  the most recent investors. As with any Ponzi scheme, Madoff relied  on robbing Peter to pay Paul. Ponzi schemes are named after an American fraudster of the 1920s,  and they are usually built around a plausible-sounding investment  story. However, these scams always collapse as soon as the demands  of investors who want to sell their investments outweigh the cash  provided by new investors. The Madoff fraud grew so large because  it survived many years. Its undoing was the credit squeeze of 2008  when too many investors, who were presumably happy with  Madoff’s reported investment performance, had to withdraw funds  to meet losses elsewhere. This caused the Madoff house of cards to  The victims were mostly based in the United States, but there  were also many from around the world. They included wealthy  individuals, charities and a number of wealth managers, but  relatively few institutional investors. Many were introduced to Madoff  through personal recommendations, which would have stressed his  respectable community and business pedigree as a former chairman  of the NASDAQ stock exchange and philanthropist. A large part of the problem is that so many people can be seduced  by the belief that they have found a low-risk way of performing  surprisingly well. And yet, surprisingly good investment performance  always involves risk. Madoff is not the only instance of large-scale fraud or suspected  fraud of the past few years and these episodes provide important  lessons for investors and for their advisers. Some of Madoff’s investors  were following the recommendations of investment advisers, who  appeared to take pride in their professional diligence in identifying  good managers. The advisers could often point to the name of one  of the leading accountancy firms as the auditor of the third-party  so-called feeder fund that was the conduit to Madoff Investment  Securities, but this provided no protection for investors. How was someone who had followed the recommendation of  an adviser or a friend supposed to identify the risks? Ten old lessons  

Setting the scene 1 	 The old and seemingly trivial saying that “if it looks too good to  be true, it probably is” remains one of the most valuable pieces of  investment advice anyone can give. 2 	 Returns in excess of the return offered by the government can be  achieved only by taking risk. 3 	 Risk is most obvious when an investment is volatile and is least  obvious when a risky investment has not yet shown much  volatility. This is rarely mentioned in books on investment. 4 	 Investors should be particularly questioning when an adviser  recommends a low volatility investment that offers superior returns. 5 	 Do not invest in something you do not understand simply because  a group of your peers is doing so. A desire to conform can explain  many decisions that we would otherwise not take. 6 	 Whatever your adviser says, make sure that your investments  are well diversified. But keep in mind that diversification is most  difficult to assess when risky investments are not obviously  7 	 Pay particular attention if an adviser gives you inconvenient  cautious advice (such as a recommendation to avoid something  that you would like to invest in). 8 	 Social status may not be a good indicator of honesty. 9 	 Do not assume that because an investment firm is regulated by  the authorities they have been able to check that everything is all  10 	The ability to rely on good due diligence on investment managers  is the key to minimising exposure to risk of fraud. An authoritative  post-mortem report on the Madoff affair is called “Madoff: a riot  of red flags”. Most private investors would not spot these red  flags, but it was not by chance that few institutional investors  lost money with Madoff. A challenge for private investors is to  ensure that they also have access to good-quality manager due

“Successfully translates sophisticated academic thinking into simple,  intuitive principles that can be used by both individual and institutional  investors. These principles are all the more valuable as Stanyer applies  them to the full range of asset classes and investment strategies available  John Campbell, Morton L. and Carole S. Olshan Professor of  Economics, Harvard University “Over the years I’ve had the privilege of reviewing many investment  books, but this is unquestionably one of the best. I could go on at  length explaining why I am so impressed but suffice it to say, it will  be a well read and prominent book in my personal library. Every  financial planner, wealth manager, broker, investment adviser and  serious individual investor owes it to themselves to carefully read this  extraordinary book.” Harold Evensky, President, Evensky & Katz, LLC “Peter Stanyer has a rare gift for making advanced and seemingly  esoteric ideas such as betrayal aversion or psychic returns not just  accessible but highly relevant. In addition to the help this guide will  provide individual investors on what to make of all the arcana flooding  from business schools and fund managers, it is a book that provides  welcome light and insight in a world in which the global financial crisis  has highlighted the importance of financial education and literacy.” Stephen Satchell, Fellow, Trinity College, Cambridge “If you want to understand the key factors in constructing a successful  investment strategy that suits you, this book will enable you to make  better informed choices.” Mark Ralphs, Partner, Financial Planning Corporation LLC 

“Broad in its overview, filled with recent data and research, and clearly  written, this useful guide should appeal to both experienced and  new investors. The author delivers relevant, practical advice by deftly  discussing both the big picture at the overall portfolio level and the  nuances and institutional details at the asset class level.” Andrew Ang, Ann F. Kaplan Professor of Business, Columbia  Business School, New York “Peter Stanyer stands out as an extraordinarily clear thinker and he  carries that clarity through to his writing in this book on, for example,  hedge funds. In addition he is tremendously good at explaining what  works best in establishing and adapting an investment strategy.
